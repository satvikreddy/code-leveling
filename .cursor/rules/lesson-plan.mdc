Lesson creation guidelines: [lesson.md](mdc:docs/lesson.md)

For reference, the builder pattern lesson readme: [readme.md](mdc:app/learn/design-patterns-using-typescript/2-builder/content/readme.md)

When asked to come up with a plan for a new pattern:
- Mention the real world example
- Explain what code example you'll come up with (no need to write code, just explain)
